'Guess the Number' game

May 31, 2018
My first project! And to think I started learning Python a week or two ago.

This game is a very basic number-guessing game. A random number is generated, the user enters a guess, and if that guess matches the random number, they win! If they're wrong they get two more tries, but then it's game over.

Since this was my first program, I heavily annotated it and have more ideas for future variations:
  * A looping version (Game Over. Try again?)
  * Pictures to pretty it up
  * Buttons? (I assume they're possibly but I'm still really new)
  
To play the game:
 1. Click on "guessTheNumber.py".
 2. Click on the green "Clone or Download" button on the top right.
 3. If you have GitHub Desktop, you can click "Open in Desktop". Otherwise you can click "Download ZIP" and open the file in Python.

Personally, I use 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) for ZIP files.
