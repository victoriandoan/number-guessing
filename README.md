'Guess the Number' game

May 31, 2018
My first project! And to think I started learning Python a week or two ago.

This game is a very basic number-guessing game. A random number is generated, the user enters a guess, and if that guess matches the random number, they win! If they're wrong they get two more tries, but then it's game over.

Since this was my first program, I heavily annotated it and have more ideas for future variations:
  * A looping version (Game Over. Try again?)
  * Pictures to pretty it up
  * Buttons? (I assume they're possibly but I'm still really new)
